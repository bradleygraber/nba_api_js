# nba_api_js 
#### A front end for endpoints documented in nba_api
#### https://github.com/swar/nba_api Endpoint source
#### https://nbastats.bradleygraber.com/ Current hosting

###### Currently there are some endpoints that will work with the default proxy (https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) and the current headers I have configured.  I don't know why, but when I host the site locally, and use cors-anywhere locally as the proxy, all endpoints work.
###### AssistLeaders, and LeagueLeaders both work with the current hosting, but most others do not.
###### Headers and Proxy are both configurable within the site.
